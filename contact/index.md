# About this site

I'm Marcus. You can find me at [at twitter](https://twitter.com/defavlt), or once every year on [that other site](https://facebook.com/defavlt).
I've also got an account [on Github](https://github.com/defavlt).

This site is under constant *(read: when I feel like it)* development, and things might change from time to time. I'm also colour-blind, which might be why the colours look strange. Submit an issue on Github if it bothers you.
